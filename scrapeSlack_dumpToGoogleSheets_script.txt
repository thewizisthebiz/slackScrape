  // Most of this code has been lifted from http://jd.mares.co/tutorials/2015/09/20/slack-google-apps-script-stand-ups.html

  // I just tried to simplify it and explain it for the purposes of helping compost haulers report and analyze their pickups automagically



  // The first thing we want to do is create a bucket data to hold the info/attributes of our google Sheet.

  // Let's call this bucket "sheets" 



  var sheets = SpreadsheetApp.openById('asdfjkl;1234567890qwertyuiop');



  // The sheet you are putting into your bucket is determined by whichever Sheet ID you paste between the single-quotes. 

  // Your Sheet ID is the garbled sequence of characters at the end of your sheet's URL. 

  // Example: if your Sheet URL is https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/asdfjkl;1234567890qwertyuiop, then you just paste: asdfjkl;1234567890qwertyuiop

  // Make sure you've got your single-quotes still around your ID.

  



  // Now, let's create a bucket of data that we can fill and refill each time you post to Slack in your specified channel, or using your specified trigger word.



  var params = request.parameters;
 


  // Remember: you can configure your channel and keywords when you setup your Slack webhooks through: myCoolTeam.slack.com/apps/manage/custom-integrations





  // Okay, so we have a bucket that has info about our google sheet, and a bucket that can hold our slack messages

  // Next, we can make a bucket which will contain the number for whatever the FIRST blank row in our sheet. This way we we won't overwrite our old data each time we post to slack.



  var nextRow = getNextRow(sheets) + 1;





  // Now we are getting to the good stuff.

  // This next line is basically a key that gives your program access to your Slack message



  if (params.token == "paste_Slack_token_here,_keep_the_quote_ marks") {





    // Then we want to make a bucket of data that can hold the TEXT of our Slack message.
 
    // And we want that data to get filtered so that the trigger word and punctuation are sifted out.

    // Here we are using the word "pickup" and ":" to start the message, so that's what we will filter out.



    var rawSlackMessage = String(params.text).replace(/^\s*pickup\s*:*\s*/gi,'');
    




    // Next we need to break the contents of our Slack messages apart so that each piece can be placed into it's own bucket.

    // Eventually that bucket will get dumped into a specific cell on your google sheet.

    // Below we are using a semi-colon ";" to delineate where your Slack message should be split up.



    var piecesOfSlackMessage = rawSlackMessage.split(/\s*;\s*/g);





    // HEADS UP: when computers keep lists they start with 0, not 1. 

    //So, you wouldn't say the first thing in a list is in slot 1, you would say the first thing in a list is in slot ZERO. Computers are dumb.

    // The following lines create buckets for each piece of your Slack message and fill it with the corresponding piece of your Slack message.



    var client         = piecesOfSlackMessage[0] || "Whoops, no client provided";
    var weight         = piecesOfSlackMessage[1] || "Dang, no weight provided";
    var containerCount = piecesOfSlackMessage[2] || "Oopsies, no container count provided";
    var containerType  = piecesOfSlackMessage[3] || "Hmmm... no container type provided";



    //In our example case, the initial piece of information in our Slack message is always the client, so we made a bucket called "client" and filled it with the piece of our Slack message in slot 0.

    //The weight of our pickup always comes after the client, so we made a bucket called "weight" and filled that bucket with the piece of our Slack message in slot 1.

    // You might have more or fewer buckets, depending on how many things you want to track.





    // Here's where the magic happens. These next lines tell the program to...

    // Go to our google sheet...
    // and find a column with a certain name...
    // and go to the bottom of that column...
    // and fill the last cell in that column with meta-data from our Slack message



    sheets.getRangeByName('date').getCell(nextRow,1).setValue(new Date());
    sheets.getRangeByName('user').getCell(nextRow,1).setValue(params.user_name);
    sheets.getRangeByName('time').getCell(nextRow,1).setValue(new Date());
    sheets.getRangeByName('timestamp').getCell(nextRow,1).setValue(params.timestamp);



    // This meta-data isn't stuff we type into Slack, it just comes automatically.
    
    // For instance: the time we sent a message, or the username of the person who sent the message.

    // Notice we use the Date more than once because we like to keep track of the DAY (Wednesday) and the the TIME (12:01 PM) separately in our Sheet.

    // If you don't want this info in your sheet, simply remove the above four lines of code and don't include named ranges in your Google sheet for these pieces of data... although it's pretty useful stuff :)



    // Next, we want to go to our google sheet...
    // and find a column with a certain name...
    // and go to the bottom of that column...
    // and dump the contents of the bucket that shares the name of the column.

    // So, dump the "client" bucket at the bottom of the "client" row in our Sheet

    sheets.getRangeByName('client').getCell(nextRow,1).setValue(client);
    sheets.getRangeByName('weight').getCell(nextRow,1).setValue(weight);
    sheets.getRangeByName('containerCount').getCell(nextRow,1).setValue(containerCount);
    sheets.getRangeByName('containerType').getCell(nextRow,1).setValue(containerType);

}

    // That's basically it!




    // This is a routine that your program uses to go to the next row, so it doesn't overwrite data.

function getNextRow(sheets) {
  var timestamps = sheets.getRangeByName("timestamp").getValues();
  for (i in timestamps) {
    if(timestamps[i][0] == "") {
      return Number(i);
      break;
    }
  }
}
}



    // That's all folks.
